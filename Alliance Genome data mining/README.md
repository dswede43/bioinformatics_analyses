# Alliance Genome Data Mining Application
This web application is used to query the [Alliance Genome of Resources consortium](https://www.alliancegenome.org/) for
biologically relevant keywords and returns lists of genes with functions associated to those keywords.
Data is obtained through API queries with [Alliance Genome's API](https://www.alliancegenome.org/swagger-ui/).
